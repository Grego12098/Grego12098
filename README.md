<p>
I'm an aspiring developer trained in Full Stack Development at the School of Code. After graduating in Mathematics and Philosophy, honing my problem solving and critical thinking skills, I began to study and trade cryptocurrency and NFTs during lockdown, building a bot in Python to track new trending NFT collections and send myself alerts via desktop push notifications. I loved the challenge of solving a problem I had with code, which led me to pursue the bootcamp. 
</p>
<p>
Since enrolling the bootcamp, I've since been dedicated to sharpening my skills as a software developer, as well as my interpersonal skills such as effective communication and teamwork. I'm currently working on improving the tests for my team projects which you can find below.
